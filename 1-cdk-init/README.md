### Related configurations of CDK

#### cdk.json
* You need to add the following line to let CDK know your application entry file:
```
{
  "app": "npx ts-node bin/hello-cdk.ts"
}
```

or, use the command `cdk --app`. [ref](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/tools.html)

#### package.json
* CDK Application: "bin" field in your package.json which is a map of command name to local file name
  ```
    "bin": {
      "cdk_app": "bin/cdk_app.js"
    },
  ```

* CDK library: "main" field is a `module` primary entry point to your program. That is, if your package is named foo, and a user installs it, and then does require("foo"), then your main moduleâ€™s exports object will be returned.
  ```
    "main": "lib/index.js"
  ```

* npm `build`, `watch`, and `test` command:
  ```
    "scripts": {
      "build": "tsc",
      "watch": "tsc -w",
      "test": "jest",
      "cdk": "cdk"
    }
  ```
