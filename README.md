## Step 0: Setup the environment

In this step, we will use cloud9 as the base environment. We will upgrade the node.js version (nvm), setup the vs-code editor, and install cdk command.

## Step 1: CDK Project Directory

CDK init and folder structures.

## Step 2: Infrastructure as code

Use EC2 with DeepLearning AMI and Jupyter Notebook Server as an examples. You will learn:

    * CDK VPC, Instance, and AMI
    * Launch EC2 with Jupyter Notebook Server
    * Amazon EC2 Instance Connect

## Step 3: CDK in CodeBuild

## Step 4: CDK in Lambda
